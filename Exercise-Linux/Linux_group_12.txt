1) Basic shell commands

1 I am in the directory /home/user. I use the command 'pwd' to find in which directory I am currently in.

2 I type the following command in the terminal:   echo "$SHELL"

3 I've created the file me.txt in my home directory.

4 I write in the terminal the name of the object that I want in backround, followed by ampersand. In this case, I write    nano me.txt &

5 I type the following command in the terminal:  mkdir /home/user/test1

6 First I copy the file with the command:  cp me.txt /home/user/test1      then I go the subdirectory, and I rename the file with the command     mv me.txt me_copy.txt

7 I have used an absolute path.

8 To go from the home directory to the subdirectory, I type the command     cd /home/user/test1
To go from the subdirectory to the home directory, I type the command    cd ..

9 While being in my home directory, I type the command 
mv /home/user/test1/me_copy.txt   /home/user/test1/me_renames.txt

10 While being in the subdirectory, I type the command      echo "01/08/1996" >> me_renames.txt
In the previous step I've renamed me_copy.txt to me_renames.txt, that's the reason why I work with the file me_renames.txt

11 In my home directory I type the command     diff me.txt /home/user/test1/me_renames.txt
The output is
1a2
> 01/08/1996

12 I use the option -h -l to show the size. I type:
ls -h -l /home/user/me.txt /home/user/test1/me_renames.txt

13 I type the following command:    rm -r /home/user/test1/

14 I type the following commands:
mkdir test2                      to create a subdirectory
cp me.txt /home/user/test2/      to copy me.txt in the subdirectory
cd /home/user/test2/             to access the subdirectory
mv me.txt me_copy1.txt           to rename the first file
cp me_copy1.txt me_copy2.txt     to copy this file with another name

For the second part, I use the command:
tar cvzf test2.tar.gz /home/user/test2

15 First I create the directory test3 with:     mkdir test3
Then I type the command    tar -zvxf test2.tar.gz -C /home/user/test3



2) More complex shell usage

1. cat `cat test.dat`                                           command for making the test.dat to print the contents of test.txt
2. awk '!(NR%1){print (($1+$2)/2 " "  $1+$2)}' col.txt          we created the document col.txt which contains two columns; in the terminal we print on two columns the results for the average and the sum for the columns in col.txt  
3. awk '!(NR%1){print (($1+$2)/2 " "  $1+$2)}' col.txt | sort   we sort the results obtained before
4. find . -name *.txt                                           we find all the files called *.txt
5. find . -name *.txt -exec cat {} + | wc -l                    we count the total number of lines of the files listed from the above find command
