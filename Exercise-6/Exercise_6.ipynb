    "- Creates a figure that is large enough to display nice images.\n",
    "- Should take ```heat_grid``` data, ```kappa```, ```deltat``` and an array with the external source locations on the grid.\n",

    "* Try different point set and enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    " * For tests you can use also different combinations for *kappa* and *timestep*. The whole simulation is only working if the change from frame to frame is small due to the discretization of the plate and time. If kappa multiplied by timestep is too large, then you will see no proper simulation but a rather oscillating state which has nothing to do with reality! Set $\\kappa=1$, $N=32\\times32$ and choose a time step of $\\Delta t=0.0001$ for the proper results.\n",
    " * You can create a figure with ```matplotlib.pyplot.figure()``` and adjust the figure size with its arguments.\n",
    " * Explore the different colormaps and choose a proper one for displaying such experiment.\n",
    " * Explore the ```matplotlib.pyplot.imshow``` arguments. ```vmin, vmax``` are useful for constraining the colorbar colors."
